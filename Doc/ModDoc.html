	<h1>Modder Documentation For Number Hunter</h1>
	<p>This documentation explains the various functions exposed to end-user modders to change and improve Number Hunter.</p>
	
	<h2>Notes on Modding This Game In General</h2>
	<p>This game does not support additional scripting or anything similar, because that would be very difficult to implement and require dynamic linking which would reduce the portability of this application, as well as requiring installation on the client machine which is not allowed according to the TSA Video Game Design rules. However, it does support changing the textures and editing config files, which have limited scripting support. This document will explain the options for modding this game, and how to define new levels. All config files follow the MS-INI standard. Also the config files are case sensitive and the game will not run with a miss configured INI file or if any resource is missing.</p>
	
	<h2>Menu Configuration</h2>
	<p>The start up menu can be configured in several ways. The position of buttons and their textures can be changed by modifying the appropriate section in the the menu config file which in located in the resources folder. The textures can be changed by specifying a valid relative path to a new resource, and updating the size of the object in the config file. The credits menu however can NOT be changed, as the credits are hard-coded in.</p>
	
	<h2>Actual Game Configuration</h2>
	<p>Main game options can be found in the heavily documented Main Config File. Difficulty and enemy setting can be edited in that file.</p>

	<h2>Level Configuration</h2>
	<p>New levels can be defined in the LevelConfig file. They must define all fields as the entries above them and the type defined must be one of the types defined below. Also the header of the next level must follow the format below.</br></br>
	[LEVEL_{n}] where {n} is the number of the level in order of the progression.</br></br>
	When adding new levels you must also set the level count in the MAIN_CONF equal to the total number of levels. If the player does not complete the goal, then the game is lost.</p>
	<p><b>NOTE: </b> The main goal is to survive for a set time period, the level type is just a sub goal, which must be met to complete the level. If the sub-goal is not met then the level is failed.</p>
	
	<h3>Possible Level Types</h3>
	<p>Listed below are possible level types. All level types have a main goal to survive for a set time. If the time is set to 0 then the player has an unlimited amount of time to complete the goal and completing that goal yields the level end. Else, the time limit denotes the level end.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"SURVIVAL" - the player must survive for a set time</li>
		<li>"MIN_SCORE" - the player must have a minimum score to progress within a set time period. if the minimum time is set to 0, then the player has unlimited time to complete this.</li>
		<li>"COLLECT_SALVAGE" - the player must collect a minimum number of salvage within a set time period.</li>
		<li>"CLEAR_ASTEROIDS" - the player must destroy a set number of asteroids to progress.</li>
	</ul>
